# Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a patient has liver disease based on various biochemical and demographic features. The analysis is performed on the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD).

## About The Project

Patients with liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhalation of harmful gases, and intake of contaminated food, pickles, and drugs. This project uses machine learning to build predictive models that can assist doctors in diagnosing liver disease, potentially reducing their burden.

### Built With

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git)
    ```
2.  Install required packages
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

The repository includes several Jupyter notebooks that explore the dataset, clean the data, and build and evaluate various classification models. The primary dataset is `indian_liver_patient.csv`.

## Models Used

This project explores and compares the performance of several machine learning models for classification, including:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
